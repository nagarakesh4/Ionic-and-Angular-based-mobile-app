# Ionic-and-Angular-based-mobile-app
This project builds a hybrid mobile application with features of ionic and angularjs. Angular's ability to fetch and filter data makes ionic powerful. 

###Components & Usage of Ionic
Ionic framework by default gives the capability to make the application responsive. This project implements components of ionic. Some components that are used in this project replicate features of native mobile applications, such as
1. <ion-reorder-button> directive along with angularjs provides the capability to easily reorder an item in a list,
2. the directive <ion-option-button> provides the option to drag a item (to mark as favorite).
3. Pull to refresh is another feature that comes handy with ionic and is implemented in this project.
